# Fried Rice

Fried rice is basically taking leftover rice and cooking it with whatever you have available in your kitchen. 

## Ingredients

Here is a list of ingredients that I have used in fried rice:

**Cooking fats and oils**
- Plant based oils (olive, coconut, peanut, etc)
- Animal based oils (bacon, duck, chicken, etc)

**Early ingredients**
- Garlic
- Onions
- Ham
- Egg

**Late ingredients**
- Leafy Greens
- Any leftovers, chopped into smaller pieces
- Frozen veggies (peas, corn, spinach)

**Sauces**
- Soy sauce
- Hoi Sin Sauce
- Worchestershire Sauce
- Biryani Paste
- Leftover sauces

**Day old rice** 
- Dry rice is better for fried rice

## General steps

1. Start with Oil or Fat
2. Add early ingredients
3. Add late ingredients 
4. Add sauces
5. Add rice
6. Add sauces

**Special directions**

**Eggs** are usually scrambled first in the oil and removed, adding it back when you add the rice. This avoids overcooking the eggs.

1. Oil and Bacon, wait until fat rendered
2. Cook egg and remove from pan
3. Cook onions
